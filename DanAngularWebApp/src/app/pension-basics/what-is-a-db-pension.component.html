    <p class="hero-description">
      A Defined Benefit (DB) pension is a retirement plan where your employer
      promises to pay you a specific amount each month when you retire, based on
      your salary and years of service. Think of it as a guaranteed income for
      life.

      <h3>Guaranteed Income</h3>
      <p>
        Your employer promises to pay you a specific amount each month in
        retirement, regardless of how investments perform. This provides
        financial security and peace of mind.
      </p>
      <div class="card-highlight">
        <strong>Key Point:</strong> The risk is on your employer, not you.

      </div>
      <h3>Formula-Based Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Your pension is calculated using a formula, typically involving your
        salary, years of service, and an accrual rate. For example: 1/60th of
        your final salary × years worked.
      </p>
      <div class="card-highlight">
        <strong>Example:</strong> £30,000 salary × 30 years × 1/60 =
        £15,000/year

      </div>
      <h3>Employer Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        Your employer manages the investments and takes on all the investment
        risk. They must ensure there's enough money to pay all promised
        benefits.
      </p>

        <p>
          If you leave before retirement, you typically keep the pension you've
          built up so far (called a "deferred pension"). This will be paid when
          you reach the scheme's retirement age. Some schemes allow transfers to
          other pension arrangements.

          <mat-panel-title> Are DB pensions still available? </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          While less common than in the past, DB pensions are still offered by
          many public sector employers (NHS, teachers, civil service) and some
          private companies. Most new private sector schemes are now Defined
          Contribution (DC) pensions.

          <mat-panel-title> How much do I need to contribute? </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          Contribution rates vary by scheme, but typically range from 5-9% of
          your salary. Your employer will contribute significantly more - often
          15-25% of payroll - to ensure the scheme can meet its obligations.

          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          In the UK, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) provides compensation if
          your employer becomes insolvent. You'll typically receive at least 90%
          of your expected pension, with full protection for those already
          retired.
