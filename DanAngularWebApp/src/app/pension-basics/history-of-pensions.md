DB pensions in the UK first started in the early twentieth century. Railway companies were among the first to set formal pension schemes up for their employees.

[Insert graph which shows the number of employees in DB pension schemes from 1936 onwards - see table below for data, ideally at each point users should be able to hover over a point in the graph, and a tooltip will show the interpretation/historical context for the change to that point in time.]
